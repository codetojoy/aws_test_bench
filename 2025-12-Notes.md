### Brain Dump

* task is a running container instance
* task definition is blueprint
    * e.g. which image from ECR and/or DockerHub
* service is a long-running collection of tasks
    * this includes replicas 
    * much like a k8s deployment
    * declared state with health etc
* a cluster is a collection of services, tasks

* Service Connect will connect services across clusters, VPCs, accounts, etc
    * much more sophisticated than simple load balancers
    * replacement, on top of, Service Discovery
    * allows DNS names/aliases for services, by use of other services
    * e.g. a load-balancer for Foo Service might pass a URI env-var http://bar-service:5150,
where `bar-service` is defined via Service Connect 
    * Service Connect is an option in task def or service?
    * also see "Namespaces" in ECS

* other aspects
* if using Secret Manager (e.g. for DockerHub), then roles must have new permissions
* also permissions for CloudWatch, etc
* often a Security Group needs to be modified
    * effectively firewall rules
    * so port forwarding needs to be configured here for sandboxes 
    * e.g. define 5150, 9000, 3000, etc
